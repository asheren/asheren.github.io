A blog that captures my journey to becoming a developer and thoughts on topics that are important to me.

You can read about establishing remote teams, mentorship, learning, bug fixes, interesting things I've learned, and conference recaps.

You can also learn about the topics I'm available to consult on.

Always a work in progress.

To Do:
- Fix the problem of google custom search css search button. It works on search engines other than chrome so I'm assuming that the google stylesheet clobbers all in chrome but not in other browsers.
