As many of you know from past posts, I was recently awarded <a href="http://www.twitter.com/crsexton">Chris Sexton</a> from the <a href="http://www.arlingtonruby.org">Arlington Ruby</a> group as my mentor. I say awarded because it’s been going really great and I think he’s awesome. I’m so glad Chris is my mentor and we’ve been meeting regularly to make sure I’m learning what I want to. This brings me to my next point, as many of you also know, I think it is very important to set goals. In addition to setting goals for myself so that I can achieve them, goal setting is a vital part of a mentor/mentee relationship. Part of being an effective mentee (I’m going to do a full post about this in the near future) is making it easy for someone to mentor you by being proactive and knowing what you want to learn and accomplish. <br /><br />One of the first things I did, before chris and I even had a chance to sit down for our first meeting, was let him know what my goals were during this time period. These goals have already changed once or twice and I can always continue to add new goals as we go along, but providing Chris with my goals sets us up for success. I know I’m going to learn a lot and he knows exactly what I want to focus on to learn. <br /><br />Here are the goals I sent him:<br />- Pair program at least once per month<br />- Determine projects to work on (building off of what I have already done and building new things)<br />- Feel more comfortable with defining my abilities<br />- Feel comfortable with looking at/thinking about projects that are in progress (not just building rails apps from scratch)<br />- Learn more about databases and become more comfortable working with them<br />- Determine how to set good programming goals (there's so much to learn, how do you determine what gets you to the next level and how to get there)<br />- Commit to OSS<br /><br />I’ve already started my first project with him of building a bot! The bot is going to be awesome and we’re going to incorporate some information that needs to go into a database in order for me to really get a better sense of working with databases, how they work, and what problems might arise when using them. I’ll definitely be doing some posts soon on the process of building a bot.<br />
