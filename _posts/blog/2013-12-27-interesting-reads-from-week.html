I'm trying something new. I'm going to try to post interesting articles I've read (or meant to read) during the week every Friday. These articles/talks/blog posts/etc. may not have been published this past week, but it means I read or watched them this week. I'll try to also post who I heard about them from, but I didn't note that this week, so it'll be just the things I read for now.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.aaronstannard.com/post/2013/12/19/The-Taxonomy-of-Terrible-Programmers.aspx" target="_blank">The Taxonomy of Terrible Programmers</a><br /><br /><a href="http://phinze.github.io/2013/12/08/pairing-vs-code-review.html" target="_blank">Pairing vs. Code Review</a><br /><br /><a href="http://blog.generalassemb.ly/sublime-text-3-tips-tricks-shortcuts/" target="_blank">Sublime Text Tips and Shortcuts</a><br /><br /><a href="http://blog.bignerdranch.com/2379-the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-tdd/" target="_blank">The Unreasonable Effectiveness of TDD</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner" target="_blank">How Developers Stop Learning: Rise of the Expert Beginner</a>
