So, you’ve been working really hard. You are able to check everything below off the list…<br /><br /><br /><ul><li>Involved in the community</li><li>Setting goals</li><li>Doing something every day</li><li>Try ruby</li><li>Ruby in 100 minutes</li><li>Read Why’s poignant guide to Ruby</li><li>Learn Ruby the Hard Way</li><li>Ruby monk</li><li>Ruby Rogues (listened to at least a few)</li><li>Learn to program by Chris Pines</li></ul><br /><br />First off, if you were able to cross all those things off the list then seriously, great job!! You’re doing a lot, you’re working your booty off, and hopefully you’re feeling good about it. At this point, you should take a few minutes to take a look back at what you’ve accomplished. Think of everything you’ve learned and everything you didn’t know a few weeks ago. Smile about it, do a mini celebration, and get excited for the rest of your journey.<br /><br />Here’s the next step… read <a href="http://www.poodr.com/" target="_blank">Practical Object Oriented Programming in Ruby (POODR)</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/sandimetz" target="_blank">Sandi Metz</a>. It’s amazing and you’ll want to reread it and keep it to refer to in the future. And start watching talks for past conferences. <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/" target="_blank">Confreaks</a> is a great site that has talks from all sort of past Ruby conferences. It’s a great way to learn about new things that you might want to look into in the future (or now!). That’s all for now. Read that book carefully to really absorb everything, watch the talks to get inspired, and the next post on learning will be moving on to incorporating Rails!!!
