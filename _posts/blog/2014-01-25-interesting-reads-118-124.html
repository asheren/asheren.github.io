This week I started working with <a href="http://www.purpose.com/" target="_blank">Purpose</a>! Working with them this past week has been really interesting and really wonderful... BUT it means that I've currently got close to 80 tabs open covering things from "new stuff to learn" to "things to read" to "things to watch". So... I have definitely not had a chance to read everything on this list yet, but they all seem like excellent pieces for the week.<div><br /></div><div>Enjoy!</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9JXH7JPjR4" target="_blank">Tips on giving good conference talks</a></div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3706-everyone-does-everything" target="_blank">Everyone does everything</a></div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://chadfowler.com/blog/2014/01/19/empathy/" target="_blank">Your most important skill - Empathy</a></div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/software-development-everyone" target="_blank">Software development for everyone</a></div><div><br /></div><div><a href="https://thunderboltlabs.com/blog/2013/11/19/efficiency-with-sublime-text-and-ruby/" target="_blank">Efficiency with Sublime Text and Ruby</a></div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://rubyconferences.org/" target="_blank">Ruby Conferences!</a> (not an article but a new awesome site)</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/code-reading/" target="_blank">Code is not literature</a></div>
