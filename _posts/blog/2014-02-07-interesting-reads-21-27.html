Well, it certainly has been a busy week for me. Fortunately, I've also come across some really interesting articles and things to read/watch. AND I've actually read all of the articles this week (except for the last one... it's a video I haven't had a chance to fully check out yet). There's a variety of stuff in here this week so ...<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.dailyworth.com/posts/2427-don-t-ever-say-you-ll-work-for-shoes-again" target="_blank">Will NOT Work for shoes!</a> I love shoes, but this is a great article about women and their workplace value.<br /><br />If you've had a rough week or are a newer developer, <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/dave-rupert/2014-February-3" target="_blank">this short post</a> is a great pick-me-up.<br /><br />Personally, I'm not very good at celebrating small wins. That, coupled with the fact that I'm getting used to a "dev" to do list, as opposed to a non-dev to do list, makes it hard sometimes to feel like I'm accomplishing greatness. <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/abi-jones/2014-january-30" target="_blank">This post</a> talks about that and some great ways to reflect regularly on your work.<br /><br />Okay, I lied!! I haven't had a chance to read <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2014/2/2/Examples-of-the-Marvel-API" target="_blank">this article</a> about the amazing new Marvel API, but I've gotta find time soon!<br /><br />On a slightly dryer note... <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input" target="_blank">here's</a> some great HTML5 documentation.<br /><br />In my new position, I'm learning Javascript... lots of Javascript, but Ember.js in particular. Since I'm new to it, I thought <a href="http://readwrite.com/2014/02/06/angular-backbone-ember-best-javascript-framework-for-you#awesm=~ov9ji6OKKpZrA5" target="_blank">this article</a> gave some interesting, basic pointers about the differences between some of the more popular JS languages.<br /><br /><a href="http://aaronkromer.com/blog/2014-02-06-open-classes-and-monkey-patching-at-retroruby.html" target="_blank">A great post</a> from Aaron based on a question asked at RetroRuby's Newbie track last week!<br /><br />And to close out this week, <a href="http://vimeo.com/61044807" target="_blank">here's a video</a> I haven't watched yet about Postgres and things you haven't found.
