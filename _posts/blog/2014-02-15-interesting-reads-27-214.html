Yes yes yes, I owe the world a more interesting blog post than just interesting reads, and I've got a bunch in the works! In the future, you can look forward to the last post on the gem, a post on ember, a random learnings post, probably a post about my first few weeks as a professional programmer (which have been crazy and amazing and exciting and scary and pretty much all the emotions) but for now, I have to just give you the interesting reads for the week. Hopefully you find them interesting as well.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://learn.adafruit.com/neopixel-tiara">Yes! This!
