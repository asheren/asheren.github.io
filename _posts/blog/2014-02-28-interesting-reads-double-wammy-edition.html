I know, last week you were so disappointed when you didn't see the weekly interesting reads posted. Truth is, I had a list of them, but hadn't had a chance to read any of them yet. Hopefully this week's double-wammy list makes up for it.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br /><a href="http://rubyrogues.com/144-rr-passion/">RR last week</a> was on passion and I think had some very interesting points.<br /><br />As I've mentioned a few times, I'm doing A LOT of Ember now. It's actually really interesting and pretty enjoyable. <a href="http://frontside.io/blog/2014/02/24/ember-and-the-future-of-the-web.html">This is a great post</a> about ember that explains reasons for using it clearly and goes into the technical components as well.<br /><br />Reading articles <a href="http://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/02/24/dumb-development-mistake-checklist/">like this</a> makes me feel better when I make these same mistakes.<br /><br />There are lots of articles about saying no, but I think <a href="https://medium.com/1000-stories/4f100a9d8099">this one</a> is actually worth a read.<br /><br />Software development <a href="http://randycoulman.com//blog/2014/02/18/software-development-reading-list/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter">reading list</a>.<br /><br />Finally, <a href="http://liz.svbtle.com/so-you-think-you-want-to-be-a-web-developer">So you want to be a software dev, but do you?</a><br /><br />
