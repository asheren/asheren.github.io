A day late is better than a week late. Here are the interesting reads (and watches) from this past week.<br /><br />Currently, I've been working on a bunch of analytics-related queries and tools. I came across <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czes-oa0yik">this video</a> about measuring which was really useful. <br /><br />ember, ember, ember!!: <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2597-lonestarruby2013-ember-on-rails-realtalk">http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2597-lonestarruby2013-ember-on-rails-realtalk</a> <br /><br />I rewatched this amazing Ben Orenstein talk this past week, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC-pQPq0acs">refactoring from good to great</a>. I had watched it a few months ago and a lot of the concepts went over my head so it's fun to see how much I've been learning! <br /><br />Related to the questions I have as a professional programmer, some days are good and some days are bad. <a href="http://happybearsoftware.com/how-to-survive-your-first-year-as-a-programmer.html">This was a great article</a> that helped me realize everyone goes through the same roller coaster. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.lauradhamilton.com/anthropomorphizing-programming-languages">For Fun</a>. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.daveperrett.com/articles/2010/12/07/comp-sci-101-big-o-notation/?utm_content=buffer0c471&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer">Beefing up those Comp Sci chops</a> <br /><br /><a href="http://threeifbywhiskey.github.io/2014/03/05/non-alphanumeric-ruby-for-fun-and-not-much-else/?utm_source=rubyweekly&utm_medium=email">For anyone who's been asked to FizzBuzz</a> <br /><br /><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">The Maker's Schedule</a>. An old article but still relevant.
