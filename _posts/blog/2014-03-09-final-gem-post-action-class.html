This is a little out of order since it's been a while since my last post on the gem I helped build, but I wanted to get it out there. Feel free to refresh your memory by re-reading these posts <a href="http://allisonsherenmcmillan.blogspot.com/2014/01/contributing-to-oss.html" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="http://allisonsherenmcmillan.blogspot.com/2014/01/storing-cookies.html" target="_blank">2</a>, and <a href="http://allisonsherenmcmillan.blogspot.com/2014/02/getting-information.html" target="_blank">3</a>. The action class is a small, fairly simple class that is mostly used to just outline all of the attributes in an action item and then also distinguished a few method for specific attributes which are more common or may be requested more often.<br /><br />The whole class looks like this:<br /><pre>class Action<br /><br />  attr_reader :attributes<br /><br />  def initialize(params) <br />    @attributes = params<br />  end<br /><br />  def title<br />    @title = attributes['title']<br />  end<br /><br />  def description<br />    @description = attributes['description']<br />  end<br /><br />  def reference_name<br />    @reference_name = attributes['reference_name']<br />  end<br /><br />  def action_key<br />    @action_key = attributes['action_key']<br />  end<br />end<br /></pre><br />The initialize method sets up the class by just creating a hash that is the attributes hash and then the rest of the methods are just pulling out specific pieces from that hash. Iâ€™m not sure if by the end of this project, this class will be separate, but to me, it felt like it was doing different stuff than the ActionFetch class so I chose to separate it out.
