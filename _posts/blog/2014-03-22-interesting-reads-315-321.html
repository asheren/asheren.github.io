A fairly diverse set of reads this week from agile development, to being a better programmer, to some cooking related things. Lots of good info in these, mostly short, posts and articles.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br /><a href="http://mikehadlow.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/coconut-headphones-why-agile-has-failed.html">Why Agile is failing</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/the-agile-holocracy/240166629">A great read on holocracy</a>. One of the highlights for me, "Dysfunction happens any time somebody can't do something because they need permission, or won't do something because they're afraid of some repercussion."<br /><br /><a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/the-corruption-of-agile/240166698">The corruption of agile</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.nicholascloud.com/2014/03/how-to-be-a-sane-programmer/">"Don't burn yourself out to be a better programmer"</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.fastcocreate.com/3027589/cataloging-creativity-ferran-adria-showcases-7-years-of-culinary-art-science?partner=newsletter">7 years of culinary science</a><br /><br /><a href="http://jangosteve.com/post/380926251/no-one-knows-what-theyre-doing">No one knows what they're doing.</a> Favorite quote: "The good news is that this makes you very not dangerous. The bad news is that it also makes you feel dumb and helpless a lot of the time."<br /><br /><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/sarahmei/unpacking-technical-decisions-mountain-west-ruby-conf-2014">Making technical decisions</a>. Really interesting talk by Sarah Mei.<br /><br /><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/skmetz/all-the-little-things-rubyonales">Sandi Metz's most recent talk slides</a>.
