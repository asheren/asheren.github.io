Last week, I went to <a href="http://emberconf.com/schedule.html">EmberConf 2014</a>. This conference was the first official Ember conference and it was fantastic. For those of you who don’t know what <a href="http://emberjs.com/">ember</a> is, it is a JavaScript framework that I’ve been working with for the past two months.  The conference was in Portland and it was a single-track, 2-day long, wonderful experience. Because I took copious notes, I figured I would do that same thing I did for <a href="http://rubyconf.org/">RubyConf</a> this past year and write up a <a href="http://allisonsherenmcmillan.blogspot.com/search/label/rubyconf%202013">post for each session</a>. Some of these will be longer, some will be shorter, and if you know Ember, PLEASE, feel free to add comments and additional thoughts. I also want to get these up pretty quickly, so there will likely be a few posted at a time.<br /><br />I’ll be honest, I was nervous going to this conference. I’ve only been to a few tech conferences so far and at most of them DC Rug and Arlington Ruby are represented pretty heavily so I generally never feel like I’m stepping into the unknown without a solid group of people to fall back on if I’m feeling lost. I’m also used to going into a conference as a “known newbie” either because it’s a smaller local conference and most people know my level of experience or, like at RubyConf, because I was an opportunity scholar. Emberconf was different. I knew a couple of people going in but they were much looser connections and again, there were few of them AND I was just one of the crowd. <br /><br />My fears and nervousness were quickly quelled at the conference though. The general atmosphere was kind and excited and everyone wanted to meet one another. I also had some great people like <a href="http://www.twitter.com/gustin">Gustin</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/crsexton">Chris</a>, and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/tundal45">Ashish</a> offer some awesome twitter introductions which really helped as well! There were a total of 430 people there, which is a pretty manageable number. This was also the first single track conference that I had been to and I really enjoyed it. I did wish there was an opportunity to switch up the table you were sitting at during the day but for the most part, it was great. You sat at a table, really got to know everyone there. There were a good number of breaks and because everyone was hearing the same sessions, there was a lot to talk about.<br /><br />The sessions were 30 minutes long, which I felt was a pretty good length for most of them, although didn’t always allow for enough Q&A time. Again, though, the benefit of a small, single track conference is that the speakers are all accessible to ask more questions to during the breaks. So, the scene is set… now onto the sessions.<br />
