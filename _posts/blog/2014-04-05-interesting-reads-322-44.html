<br />You'd think with two weeks of reading I'd have more interesting things, but not so much that past two weeks. The reads below are really good but I've been a little more heads down recently and haven't had the chance to read as much. Anyway, there are some good, interesting posts below, so check them out and enjoy!<br /><br />Doing Your Best Work: <a href="http://www.naildrivin5.com/blog/2014/03/16/doing-your-best-work.html">http://www.naildrivin5.com/blog/2014/03/16/doing-your-best-work.html</a><br /><br />The Last Developer was Terrible: <a href="https://medium.com/p/506a06ae35ea">https://medium.com/p/506a06ae35ea</a><br /><br />Old but still interesting: <a href="http://rachelnabors.com/2012/04/of-github-and-pull-requests-and-comics/">http://rachelnabors.com/2012/04/of-github-and-pull-requests-and-comics/</a><br /><br />A good first day: <a href="http://guillecarlos.com/developers-first-day-at-work.html">http://guillecarlos.com/developers-first-day-at-work.html</a>
