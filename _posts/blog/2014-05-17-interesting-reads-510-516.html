I have 8 RailsConf talks bookmarked to watch but I know I won't be able to watch all of them before posting, so I guess I'll have to include them in next week's roundup. That being said, below are a good handful of talks that I've already had a chance to watch and they are awesome so enjoy!<br /><br />Coraline's great talk on apprenticeship: <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3346-railsconf-artisans-and-apprentices">http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3346-railsconf-artisans-and-apprentices</a><br /><br />10 years keynote: <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3337-railsconf-keynote-10-years">http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3337-railsconf-keynote-10-years</a><br /><br />Reading Code good (but also is more about becoming better programmers specifically through this method of reading code): <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3342-railsconf-reading-code-good">http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3342-railsconf-reading-code-good</a><br /><br />In more personal news, I'm starting a new job next week!! I'm very excited to start at a new place but worried I'll be the weakest person on the team (a very common fear, I've been told). While I don't necessarily feel like a phony, I just feel new and still pretty inexperienced. This is an interesting read about how a lot of others feel similarly: <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImAPhonyAreYou.aspx">http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImAPhonyAreYou.aspx</a><br /><br />I'm trying to start getting into hardware hacking a bit more and arduinos fascinate me, but I've had a hard time figuring out where to start. Ruby Rogues did a great podcast on hardware hacking! This was one of the super helpful resources: <a href="http://juliahgrace.com/intro-hardware-hacking-arduino.html">http://juliahgrace.com/intro-hardware-hacking-arduino.html</a>
