There's a whole boatload of good stuff this week! First, There are links to three more talks from RailsConf. Then another talk about leveling up. After that a few interesting blog posts. Finally, agood explanation of dotfiles.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://twitter.com/seanmarcia">Sean Marcia</a> is awesome and this is his great talk about Bees and saving the world: <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3318-railsconf-saving-the-world-literally-with-ruby-on-rails">http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3318-railsconf-saving-the-world-literally-with-ruby-on-rails</a><br /><br />Harking back to my management days a bit, this is a good talk about decision making and team working in tech: <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3487-railsconf-workshop-teamwork-ain-t-always-easy">http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3487-railsconf-workshop-teamwork-ain-t-always-easy</a><br /><br />Okay, I think I've only made it through 5 databases so far but interesting overviews: <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3374-railsconf-an-ode-to-17-databases-in-33-minutes">http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3374-railsconf-an-ode-to-17-databases-in-33-minutes</a><br /><br />Another talk, but not from RailsConf, about taking your engineering role to the next level: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgxEmiMJVq4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgxEmiMJVq4</a><br /><br />Information anxiety and how to parse through what you need/want to learn: <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/keeping-up-and-just-in-time-learning/">http://blog.codinghorror.com/keeping-up-and-just-in-time-learning/</a><br /><br />Great post on mentorship: <a href="https://medium.com/theli-st-medium/have-some-coffee-9e468d958e77">https://medium.com/theli-st-medium/have-some-coffee-9e468d958e77</a><br /><br />Interesting post on coding principles every engineer should know. Do you agree? Which would you add?: <a href="https://medium.com/on-coding/coding-principles-every-engineer-should-know-b946b48cc946">https://medium.com/on-coding/coding-principles-every-engineer-should-know-b946b48cc946</a> <br /><br />Lastly, this week I had to set up my first new computer for development. A friend passed this along to me. It's a great step-through of dot files which, I think, seem super intimidating, but aren't IRL: <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/setting-up-a-mac-dev-machine-from-zero-to-hero-with-dotfiles--net-35449">http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/setting-up-a-mac-dev-machine-from-zero-to-hero-with-dotfiles--net-35449</a><br /><br />
