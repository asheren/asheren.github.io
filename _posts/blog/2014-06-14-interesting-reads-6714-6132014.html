Busy busy busy this week but I was still able to read a few interesting things. Even though I'm not using Ember on a daily basis anymore, it's still an interesting framework to me so there's an ember post, a little bit of debugging, and then two good soft skills posts. Finally, I haven't had time to finish watching all the railsconf talks I want to but I'm not sure when that will happen so i'll post the talks that are still on my list below.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br /><br />Learn to code, learn to think: http://www.npr.org/blogs/13.7/2014/06/09/320309576/learn-to-code-learn-to-think<br /><br />Feeling like a fraud?
