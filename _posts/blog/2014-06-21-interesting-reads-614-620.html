Short on time this weekend, but lots of good reads both very technical and not. A few great reads for newer developers.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />I recently got an Up and I love it. I also love when companies do interesting things with their data like Jawbone did in this post: <a href="https://jawbone.com/blog/the-divided-states-of-steps/">https://jawbone.com/blog/the-divided-states-of-steps/</a><br /><br />Mise en Place and organizing your day: <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-spend-the-first-10-minutes-of-your-day/">http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/06/how-to-spend-the-first-10-minutes-of-your-day/<br /></a><br /><br />OoooOOOooo, Thoughtbot's playbook. A really interesting read for anyone working for a tech company or interested in working for one. I'm amazed at their level of documentation here: <a href="http://playbook.thoughtbot.com/">http://playbook.thoughtbot.com/</a><br /><br />Swift and Ruby: <a href="http://littlelines.com/blog/2014/06/11/why-rubyist-will-love-swift">http://littlelines.com/blog/2014/06/11/why-rubyist-will-love-swift</a><br /><br />This is a great, interesting resourceâ€¦ and I've actually been asked a bunch of these questions in interviews: <a href="http://www.toptal.com/ruby-on-rails#hiring-guide">http://www.toptal.com/ruby-on-rails#hiring-guide</a>
