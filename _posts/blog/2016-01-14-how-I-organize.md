I am a busy lady. I've got a husband and am the dedicated mom to a toddler son. I speak at conferences. I run a meetup. I help organize other meetups. I meet weekly with a mentor. I'm on the RailsConf program committee. I'm a full time developer. I have run the ruby and rails scholar/guide program. I'm part of an Elixir book club. I'm a part of a social book club. I am NOT a senior developer. I keep my inbox clear and clean. Man, i'm almost exhausted just writing all of those things.

This is a lot. Really, almost a crazy amount of stuff to be doing on a regular basis. If I wasn't organized, I would probably go crazy. So, I thought i'd share how I juggle all these things and make sure no balls get dropped.

[Tweetdeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/): Twitter is an important part of how I learn and find interesting things to read. I use tweetdeck to organize my twitter streams and people I follow into specific categories and then I have them listed in order or priority. There are some streams I check twice a day, while others I just check once a week or when I have time. It helps me keep focus on a specific subject and stay in context amidst the twitter noise. It also helps me not miss important announcements like conferences cfp openings or meetups and keep up with friends.

[EverNote](https://evernote.com/): This is now a legacy system for me because of their changed pricing, but evernote was great when I used it. It's flexible and searchable. You can even take pictures of things you've written by hand and that will also be searchable (sort of... depending on how legible your handwriting is). You can also organize things into notebooks and you can open up notes in separate windows enabling you to look at multiple notes at once. I use evernote to keep track of to-do lists, thoughts, blog post ideas, conference talk proposals (before they're fully formulated), code notes, and terminal commands or screenshots after walking through code so I can look over it again in the future. The downside is the new free plan limits you to 2 devices and there are always syncing issues.

[OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/): I switched to OneNote when EverNote changed to having their service only available on 2 devices. OneNote is pretty good. The same syncing issues exist in OneNote as do in EverNote. Additionally, the thing sthat really drives me crazy is that OneNote is constantly asking me to sign in in order to sync. But there are some great features. Besides being able to use it for the same purposes as EverNote above (ie- idea management, notebooks, code notes, etc.), but within a notebook, these items can show up as tabs and within tabs you can have many pages. So, for example, I create a list of items I'd like to cover in my weekly 1:1s. I keep a 1:1s tab in my work notebook and then under the tab, I have a "page" for every week. It's easy to find the notebook/tab/page when the meeting rolls around or when I have an item to add to it. The major downside to OneNote is that you can't open up tabs, notes, or pages into separate windows so you can only look at one note at a time. In terms of note-taking/to do type applications, I've also heard good things about [todoist](https://en.todoist.com/), [wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/), and, if you've got some $$, [Ulysses](https://www.ulyssesapp.com/).

[Airmail](http://airmailapp.com/):

[Github repos](https://github.com/): (for private projects and keeping track of speaking proposals and conference submissions)

[Calendars](https://www.google.com/calendar), a few of them: both for immediate and future reminders

[OneTab](https://www.one-tab.com/):

To-Do lists:

Personal retros:

Time blocking for specific types of tasks:

None of these tools are perfect. There are trade-offs to each one. I'd love to hear your favorite apps for organizing!
