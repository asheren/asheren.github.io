A few months ago, I was learning how to balance being a new-ish software developer and a new mom. I reached out to a few mothers in the community and was amazed at what I heard. Every mom talked about facing similar challenges which got me thinking... do all parents feel this way? Are we all feeling isolated about the same issues?<div><br /></div><div>As a result, I put together a survey and tweeted it out to parents (mothers and fathers) who are also developers. The results have been fascinating and very telling of issues and trends in this area.</div><div><br /></div><div>The great people at Ruby on Ales allowed me to speak about the survey and it's findings this past weekend (video will be posted once it's available).</div><div><br /></div><div>As I mentioned in the talk, this research will be ongoing. The more data I can collect, the better! If you are a developer and a parent, or know someone who is, <i>Please</i>&nbsp;fill out this survey if you have a chance. It's super short and we're all busy parents so don't worry about complete sentences or well-thought out responses... just a simple stream of consciousness is more than okay with me!</div><div><br /></div><div>Thank you in advance!!! And ping me if you've got any questions.</div><div><br /></div><div>Survey link:&nbsp;<a href="https://allisonmcmillan.typeform.com/to/BbVmbH">https://allisonmcmillan.typeform.com/to/BbVmbH</a></div>
