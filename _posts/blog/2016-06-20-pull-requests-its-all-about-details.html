<div class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s talk about pull requests. Most people I know operate through a PR system at work. The basic process goes like this:</span></div><ol class="ol1"><li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Write code</span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Push up the branch and create a pull request</span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Put a few details in the description about what changes were made</span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Wait for comments</span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Improve code based on comments if needed</span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Ship it</span></li></ol><div class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1">The description portion of the Pull Request can be incredibly important though in making sure your code is reviewed effectively and getting better comments. This is something I’ve been focusing on personally recently and that we’ve been focusing on more as a team. Even though putting more thought and effort into crafting a pull request takes a little more time, it helps us QA much more effectively and allows us to have better context when reviewing each other’s code.</span></div><div class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1">So here are some quick tips to crafting effective PRs.</span></div><div class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1">First, start with user stories. This is something I only recently started doing but it basically acts as a summary of what is going on in english. As a ___, when I ___, I want to see ___.</span></div><div class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></div><div class="p1"><span class="s3">Example:</span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>As a developer,</i></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>When I go to the github repo’s readme</i></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>I want to see clear instructions to get set up</i></span></div><div class="p2"><span class="s1"><i></i></span><br /></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>As a developer,</i></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>When I go to the github repo’s readme</i></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>I want the setup instructions to work</i></span></div><div class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></div><div class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1">Second, what happened bullet points. This is just an overview of the biggest changes. It should potentially re-iterate some of your git commit history but not all of it. If you’re still working on creating a clear git commit history with small, specific commits, this section might be a little bigger.&nbsp;</span></div><div class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1">Third, screen shots. To take a screenshot of a specific portion of a screen, on a mac, you use SHIFT + CMD + 4. It’s often helpful to annotate that screenshot by placing arrows or text onto the image. An easy way to do this is to open the screenshot, open the toolbox, and place the arrow shape into the image and then save it. You can see where all these things are below.</span></div><div class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Open Toolbox</b></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><br /></b></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zSCI9PbvwrM/V2g20sItwYI/AAAAAAAAAYk/NcCUT5teuFMhf1df6XJMseWYvNethLC_wCK4B/s1600/open_toolbox.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="57" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zSCI9PbvwrM/V2g20sItwYI/AAAAAAAAAYk/NcCUT5teuFMhf1df6XJMseWYvNethLC_wCK4B/s400/open_toolbox.png" width="400" /></a></b></span></div><div class="p2"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br /></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Select Shape</b></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><br /></b></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VrWlzBfEOU0/V2g232ocXDI/AAAAAAAAAYs/ETsPuNQbX54rChGfSKFKp7Xt_XYvg4g1ACK4B/s1600/select_arrow_option.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="56" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VrWlzBfEOU0/V2g232ocXDI/AAAAAAAAAYs/ETsPuNQbX54rChGfSKFKp7Xt_XYvg4g1ACK4B/s400/select_arrow_option.png" width="400" /></a></b></span></div><div class="p2"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br /></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Select arrow option</b></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><br /></b></span></div><div class="p1"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hicTeYSPXN8/V2g2tNZhoBI/AAAAAAAAAYc/UT__yQfRz0AWpFyw8ggRSrAExU-f3KR3gCK4B/s1600/choose_shape.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="52" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hicTeYSPXN8/V2g2tNZhoBI/AAAAAAAAAYc/UT__yQfRz0AWpFyw8ggRSrAExU-f3KR3gCK4B/s400/choose_shape.png" width="400" /></a><span class="s1"><b><br /></b></span></div><div class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><br /></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><br /></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><br /></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1">Fourth, record video or screencast. I’m not great at recording a demo video but screencasts can be really helpful. <a href="http://recordit.co/" target="_blank">RecordIt</a> was recommended to me and it’s been great so far. It’s really simple to understand, use, and post where necessary.&nbsp;</span></div><div class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1">Fifth, Add QA instructions as a checklist. At my company, developers do a pretty in depth QA of each other’s issues in addition to code review. Creating a QA checklist also helps you as a developer think through possible edge cases or flag critical paths that need a more in depth look. This QA checklist should be specific, include links and then what should be seen. It’s often easiest to make this as a checklist so that whoever is QA’ing can just check off the items as the QA. The example below is VERY simple, but hopefully it is easy to imagine what instructions for a more complex feature or bug fix might look like.</span></div><div class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></div><div class="p1"><span class="s3"><b>Example:</b></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1">Go to <a href="http://www.allisonsherenmcmillan.blogspot.com/"><span class="s3">www.allisonsherenmcmillan.blogspot.com</span></a> and sign in as an admin</span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1">Go to the consulting tab</span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1">[ ] You should see bold headlines</span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1">Sign out of the admin role</span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1">Go to the consulting tab</span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1">[ ] You should still see the bold headlines</span></div><div class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></div><div class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1">Sixth, add labels in Github. This is more in reference to the code review processSome of the labels we use include things like “Ready for improvement”, “Don’t merge or review”, etc. Sometimes if I don’t have time to complete the description for a PR, I’ll just temporarily slap a “Don’t merge or review” label on there until I can complete it.</span></div><div class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br /></div><br /><div class="p1"><span class="s1">Finally, open your PR and get excited for some great feedback. By spending more time on your PR description, you'll get better feedback and you'll be able to ship more confidently.</span></div>
