Well, I certainly have been remiss at updating the blog but it is for good reason!
Life has been crazy. In addition to starting a new job at [Collective Idea](http://www.collectiveidea.com){:target="_blank"} (blog post coming soon), I have also had the honor of recently speaking at
the inaugural [Chicago Women in Tech conference](https://chiwomenintech.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"} and getting accepted
to speak at [RubyConf](http://www.rubyconf.com){:target="_blank"} in November. A very exciting and
busy fall season for me but I promise to try to be better at updating more often.
