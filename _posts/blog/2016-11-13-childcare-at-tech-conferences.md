A few months ago, I brought Devin to [Strange Loop](http://www.thestrangeloop.com/index.html) in St. Louis. While I did a summary of the conference, I never linked to a few other posts I wrote specifically about the experience of bringing him. Devin loved his first tech conference and, as a mom traveling solo with him, I learned a lot about what information I need from organizers as well as what I as a parent need to think about.

Those posts weren't up here but instead were posted in conjunction with the Leaky Abstractions group on Medium. Here are the links to those posts...
