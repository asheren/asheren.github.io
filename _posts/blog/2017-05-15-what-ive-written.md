As you may know, I blog in 2 places; here and on the fantastic [Collective Idea blog](https://collectiveidea.com/blog){:target="_blank"}. Recently, I've posted some pieces there that I wanted to share.

First, I posted about what I think makes a [strong conference proposal](https://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2017/02/21/how-to-write-a-more-effective-conference-proposal){:target="_blank"} from my experience reading over 500 talk proposals for RailsConf. Also related to RailsConf was how to [RailsConf successfully](https://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2017/04/21/conferencing-success){:target="_blank"}.

Then, I did a fun piece on [how we work remotely](https://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2017/05/01/working-remotely){:target="_blank"} with some tips from the team.

After, I wrote up [running a retrospective through the lens of your company's core values](https://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2017/05/02/tailoring-retrospectives-by-using-core-values){:target="_blank"}. After all, they should be more than just posters on the wall.

And most recently, I wrote about an excellent workshop I attended at [Codeland Conf](http://codelandconf.com/){:target="_blank"} about [Web Based Virtual Reality](){:target="_blank"}.
