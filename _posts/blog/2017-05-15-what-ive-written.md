As you may know, I blog in 2 places; here and on the fantastic [Collective Idea blog](https://collectiveidea.com/blog/author/allison-mcmillan){:target="_blank"}. Recently, I've posted some pieces there that I wanted to share.

* What I think makes a [strong conference proposal](https://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2017/02/21/how-to-write-a-more-effective-conference-proposal){:target="_blank"} from my experience reading over 500 talk proposals for RailsConf. Also related to RailsConf was how to [RailsConf successfully](https://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2017/04/21/conferencing-success){:target="_blank"}.

* A fun piece on [how we work remotely](https://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2017/05/01/working-remotely){:target="_blank"} with some tips from the team.

* [Running a retrospective through the lens of your company's core values](https://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2017/05/02/tailoring-retrospectives-by-using-core-values){:target="_blank"}. After all, they should be more than just posters on the wall.

* An excellent workshop I attended at [Codeland Conf](http://codelandconf.com/){:target="_blank"} about [Web Based Virtual Reality](https://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2017/05/12/diving-into-web-based-virtual-reality){:target="_blank"}.

A few posts based on conferences I've been speaking at:
* [Write/Speak/Code and what makes it so special](https://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2017/10/06/code-a-conference-for-doers){:target="_blank"}.

* [Strange Loop and the power of learning](https://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2017/10/11/when-strange-loop-melts-your-brain-melt){:target="_blank"}.

* [All Things Open and Open Source at Collective Idea](https://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2017/11/14/the-truth-about-our-open-source){:target="_blank"}.

I hope you enjoy!
