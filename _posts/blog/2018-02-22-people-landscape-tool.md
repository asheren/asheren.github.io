In my role as the Director of Employee Experience, I do a lot of thinking about the company's landscape and how each individual employee fits in to that. We know that talent retention, especially in a competative industry like Software Development, is incredibly important and that talent replacement is expensive. It doesn't just cost money to ramp someone up on a new codebase but it also costs money to interview that person, review applicants, and get the right person in the door. Additionally, developers and teams in general that are constantly learning, growing, and improving themselves lead ot a better, more competative company.

In order to bridge together these initiatives and ideas, I went looking for a tool. Something similar to the business model canvas which can provide teammates and myself as the executor of these pieces with a sense of the bigger picture. How do these ideas and initiatives not only make employees happy and encourage them to stay at Collective idea, but also increase our bottom line and make us a better business?

And I found.... nothing!! There are lots of tools to assess business needs. Things like a SWOT analysis, Porter's five forces, or the business model canvas I mentioned earlier but nothing that looks at the people side of things specifically.

While I want to change the diagramming of this in the future, for now, I decided to take the business model canvas and alter it to be the People landscape.

The People landscape is broken up in to seven different parts.

1. Key partners. Who are the people executing and supporting these initiatives?

2. Key resources. Where are we geting these materials from? this is a variety of items from staff role modeling, to specific documents that have been set up and outlined in order to accomplish the key activities.

3. Key activities. This is HOW we accomplish the business outcomes. For us, there are six of these. Team lead trainings which are specific professional development for team leads based on their role. 1 on 1s which help every individual learn, grow, and accomplish their goals. Goal setting which actually helps everyone think through what a SMART goal looks like and how to set goals in a way that they don't just fall to the wayside. [i].Grow which is a self-assessment tool (right now) containing four categories (vision, leadership, communication, and expertise) and four levels in each category. Folks take a survey related to their specific job function that asks questions about specific tasks and based on those answers provides the individual with a chart explaining what level they are at in each category. An individual's [i].Grow assessment helps them set goals and provides important conversation starters for 1:1s. A clear company mission and vision which enables individuals to tie their goals and learning goals to the company as a whole and where the larger company envisions itself in the next 1, 3, and 10 years. Finally, company-wide trainings which are periodic opportunities to recognize an area of growth for the company as a whole and every individual inside the company.

4. Value propositions. For this cateogry, I was really looking at the why. Why would the company care about spending time or effort on any of these initiatives. The why has to be thought of from a variety of angles and, as you can see on the document, the value propositions here relate to both employee interests and retention, as well as company goals and staying competative within the market.

5. Employee Relationships. This is similar to the employee related value propositions but even more closely tied to the employee experience. Why should employees care about these initiatives? And, if the initiatives work as intended, then what will the company's relationship with each individual employee be?

6. Business Outcomes. This is arguably the most important category. A business needs to care about it's people BUT it also needs to be concerned with the bottom line because you can't take care of your people if your business is suffering. Additionally, it's often an overlooked factor. Businesses think that by offering people-related initiatives or spending time on goal setting, it's solely benefitting the individuals, but, if done right, it actually has a tremendously positive affect on the company. These outcomes relate to charging more for services, setting effective budgets, increased brand reach, and more.

7. Channels. The last category is fairly straigth forward. It documents HOW this information gets out to everyone. What are the channels and ways you connect with your team and employees about these intiatives.

The People landscape is a very powerful tool. It enabled me to think through the links between each of these things and provides a much clearer picture to both the individuals at the company and the leadership about what these initiatives are, why they are important, and how they are executed without getting too deep in to implementation details. I definitely want to figure out a more effective way of visualizing these components in the future but for now, it's a helpful document that can be used for guidance and planning purposes moving forward.
