I think a lot about hiring balanced teams and what i'm looking for when I hire. Oftentimes, there is some technical ability but more than that, i'm often looking for a particular type of person. Who can I add to the team who won't mesh well with the culture but actually bring the team, team dynamic, project, and team culture to a whole new place. It's an ambitious goal but hiring someone is a big rsponsibility... to your team, to the individual being hired, and to the company.

So, how did I learn this? How do I figure out what i'm looking for on the team? and how can a process help figure that out?

learn:
- working on a variety of teams from a lot of different perspextives
- sendings a lot of birthright busses and learning to look at and for potential in addition to current

Figure out:
- what are strenghts? what are areas of growht?
- what are people's motivations? what do they talk about that gets them excited?
- Where/how have you seen each person on your team perform at their best? Or if you haven't seen this, when you ask them, what do they talk about?

process:
- application questions
- picking up on nuggets from other interviews
- behavioral questions
-

also important to not put someone in to a lion's den. Even if you with your team was ready for someone more junior, someone more diverse, etc. unless you as a manager can prep the team and get them ready for that, don't throw someone in there and hope they can have th etough conversations to get the team to that point.
