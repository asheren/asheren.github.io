A bulleted list of the ways in which being a parent makes me a better manager

- empathizing with another's perspective
- being ok with someone being unable to see my logic or thought process
- responding to other's emotions with kindness and patience
- recognizing that another's understanding may be completely different than mine
- knowing that even when I think im being clear, i'm probably not
- adjusting my personal styles to fit someone else's
- (parent of multiple children) knowing that each person is an individual and what works for one may not work for another
- being confident in the fact that sometimes providing boundaries or rules help the result
- being comfortable knowing that sometimes I will need to do something that will not make another person happy
- being ok with someone responding unhappily and at least trying to help them understand the reasoning behind the decision or request
- knowing that the more resources I can get, the better I will be
- understanding deeply that I will always need to work on being better
- telling the difference between what is important and what isn't to me which helps me realize what decisions I can fully empower another to make
- knowing that I won't know if I've done a good job or not for a long time
- Being efficient AF
- recognizing tradeoffs and their impact on project, work, home, and other individuals
- Constantly coming up with creative solutions, compromises, and suggestions
