NEEDS TO BE FINISHED 

I recently took on new responsibilities at work. I'm not running the communication and collaboration department at GitHub!! This involved setting up an entirely new department as well as the new role of managing managers, something i've done a bit of in the past but not quite at this scale.

- vision, mission, values for the department
- slack channel
- manager sync
- department all hands
- skip levels
- office hours
- semi-monthly communications

future vision
- unconf
- retros
- open brainstorm
- better chatter between teams
