how i do goal setting

- think about them less of goals and more as where do you want to be in a year?
- what is relaistic? and what does that look like?
- what are your areas of growth and do I agree with that assessment?
- if not, let's talk about it and make sure we're on the same page

- goal setting is a communication tool
- ultimate goal
- where are your areas of growth to get there (or, if it's multiple years away, what can you do to show growth... as you get more senior, it will take longer and involve more to achieve the next level)
- then come up with specific examples and measureables to get there
- also helps me be aware of what opportunities to look for

- there are some htings a person will be able to acheieve on their own. others they'll need to have their name put in the hat for ... for these, your manager needs to know you want experience there

- and then we do quarterly goals... 1 or 2 that are based on breaking down your annual goal and 1 or 2 that are based on immediate previous qurters feedback. try for no more than 3 per quarter
- goals should be a part of the person's performance review... did they make progress towards achieving it.
- I can't help you achieve what I don't know you want to achieve 


My personal goals

- what my goals are (more broadly) and why they are important
