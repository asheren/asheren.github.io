[Parent Driven Development]() is 2 years in! I can hardly believe it. Here are some milestones:
- We've recorded over 40 episodes covering a whole variety of topics, issues, ideas, geniuses, and failures.
- We've said goodbye to some panelists and welcome new ones
- We have listeners in _____ countries
- We've had episodes that have hit almost 800 listens.
- We've hired an incredible assistant who's helped to so much to keep us on track

I'm really happy with what we've been able to do so far and I **think** folks who listen to the podcast have enjoyed, laughed, maybe cried a little, learned, and felt less lonely  as a parent in tech. But I've still got big plans for this podcast because it's important.

Someone once asked me what would you do to get to your goal if there were no boundaries or obstacles? I've started thinking about challenging projects of opportunities in this way because it frees me from my concerns about thinking about what's realistic or not, and allows me to simply dream big. With that in mind, here are some of my goals for the 3rd year of [Parent Driven Development]().

- More support in general
Right now I'm paying out of pocket for all PDD expenses which includes audio editing, podcast assistant costs, website hosting, etc.
- More patreon supporters
- sponsors
- advertisers

- Do more with more support 
There is SO MUCH MORE we could do once we're breaking even and maybe getting a little more. For starters, a few small things i'd love to tackle this year would be: Swag (hello onesies, nursing tanks, and more!), and small gatherings or get togethers at conferences or events which could include some live recording.

- More listeners 
We haven't done badly but our numbers could be better. We're doing more with social media and engaging with different content or brands that we love and who hopefully love us. We're hoping
