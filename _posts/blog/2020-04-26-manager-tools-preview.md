These last few weeks have obviously not gone as planned. I had big goals this year of finally putting all of my manager tools, tips, and templates in one place... a [Manager Tools repo](https://github.com/asheren/manager_tools) that is public and open to anyone looking for these sorts of resources. Ironically, the section I completed before COVID-19 changed our world was about offsites, lol. While I don't have as much time to work on it currently, I wanted to briefly mention what's to come.

First, I've been slowly but surely chipping away at a remote section, talking about being a manager for remote teams. You can check out the outline of what that section will look like [here](https://github.com/asheren/manager_tools/blob/remote-teams/Managing-Remote-Teams/remote-teams-outline.md). Once that section is complete, i'm excited to jump back in to offsites, working on how to craft virtual offsites. I've been thinking about this a lot recently as well as taking some trainings. While a virtual offsite isn't the same as an in-person one, there are a lot of really amazing things you can do and some things that you _can_ do virtually that you _can't_ do in person. I hope you enjoy these sections as I eventually finish them and get them out there.
