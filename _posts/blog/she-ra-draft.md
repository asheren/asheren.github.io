As some of you know, this idea of business/management lessons from the She-Ra reboot has been on my to do list for a WHILE. I'm finally starting it!!! Here's episode 1.

In episode 1: The Sword, Part 1, we begin by understanding the lessons and perspective that are provided to us. The whole episode starts with the portrayal of the princesses as evil and kaniving individuals who need to be freed.
