Hi. I'm the Vice President of Engineering at [QuotaPath](https://www.quotapath.com/){:target="_blank"}, a company that provides compensation transparency and ease in administering variable compensation plans. I was previously the Head of Engineering at [Forem](https://www.forem.com){:target="_blank"}, the platform that powers [Dev.to](https://www.dev.to){:target="_blank"} and Code Newbie and a Director of Engineering at [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"}, managing a variety of teams and products including Atom, Pull Requests, Repositories, and launching Codespaces. Formerly a software engineer, startup founder, Senior Program Director and community builder at the University of Michigan, and Managing Director of a national non-profit. 

I started programming at a Rail Girls workshop a few years ago and then became a chapter organizer. I [speak](http://daydreamsinruby.com/speaking){:target="_blank"} at conferences on a variety of topics like mentorship, working remotely, garbage collection, understanding conflict-free replicated data types, and being a parent in tech. I also launched and recorded over 70 episodes of a podcast called [Parent Driven Development](http://www.parentdrivendevelopment.com/){:target="_blank"} which focuses on stories and resources for being a parent in tech, or understanding what it is like to be a parent in tech. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me encouraging my kid's climbing skills, rubbing noses with my toddler, or pretending I have time to bake. I live in the Washington, DC area. I've always been extremely involved in the community, serving on the board and as board president for [Ruby Central](https://www.rubycentral.org), the primary community organizing nonprofit for the Ruby programming language, organizing [United Silver Spring Ruby](http://www.meetup.com/United-Silver-Spring-Ruby/){:target="_blank"}, RailsGirls DC, and a variety of other meetups and events.

I am available for [consulting](http://daydreamsinruby.com/consulting){:target="_blank"} on various topics and [speaking engagements/conference keynotes](http://daydreamsinruby.com/speaking){:target="_blank"}.
