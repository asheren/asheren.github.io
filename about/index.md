Hi. I'm a Software Engineer and Director of Happiness at [Collective Idea](http://collectiveidea.com/){:target="_blank"} with a few careers in my past. I've been a startup founder, community builder at the University of Michigan, and Managing Director of a national non-profit. I started programming at a Rail Girls workshop a few years ago and then became a chapter organizer. I speak at conferences on a variety of topics including mentorship, working remotely, garbage collection, and being a parent in tech. When I'm not coding, you can find me encouraging my toddler's climbing skills or pretending I have time to bake. I live in the Washington, DC area and previously organized [United Silver Spring Ruby](http://www.meetup.com/United-Silver-Spring-Ruby/){:target="_blank"} along with a few other meetups and events.

I am available for [consulting](http://daydreamsinruby.com/consulting){:target="_blank"} on various topics and [speaking engagements/conference keynotes](http://daydreamsinruby.com/speaking){:target="_blank"}.

You can learn more about my professional experience by looking at my
[CV](http://daydreamsinruby.com/Allison_McMillan_CV.pdf){:target="_blank"} or LinkedIn Profile.
