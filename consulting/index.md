As an Engineering leadership consultancy, we provide strategic guidance, mentorship, and support to help you achieve your goals and objectives. 

We understand the unique challenges faced by today's engineering leaders. Building high-performing, well-managed, and happy teams is critical to achieving business success. In fact, teams that perform at a high level are more likely to achieve their goals and objectives, deliver better results, and maintain higher levels of engagement and retention leading to less turnover and higher productivity rates.

We offer customized solutions to help you navigate these challenges, optimize your team's performance, and create a culture of excellence.
 
We help Engineering Leaders achieve these goals through 3 types of services:
<br>
<h4>Part-time or interim VP of Engineering engagements </h4>

<i> You may not have the need or budget for a full-time VP of Engineering but you need someone with experience and expertise working collaboratively with both your engineering team and your leadership team to get to success. Bringing in a fractional VP of Engineering can lead to a faster time to market, a increase in engineering team productivity, and a reduction in engineering costs while also driving higher levels of employee satisfaction and retention. Solve those problems and set your company up for a better VP of Engineering or CTO hire when you're ready.</i>

<br>
<h4>Virtual or in-person offsite planning</h4>

<i> Team, department, and company offsites are EXPENSIVE, not just to execute them but also the cost of taking people away from their day-to-day work for multiple days. It's critical to find a balance between business goals and employee retention activities. You need to ensure that the offsite is engaging and memorable (which doesn't have to mean expensive) from beginning to end. Employees that have strong workplace friendships feel more engaged and satisfied at work. Our team offsite planning services are designed to help you build stronger relationships, enhance communication, and foster a culture of collaboration and innovation. We'll work with you to plan a customized offsite that meets your unique needs and goals and that YOU can confidently execute. Spend time together that has lasting effects well beyond just that week.</i>

<br>
<h4>1-on-1 advising and mentoring</h4>

<i> We are committed to helping individuals build the necessary skills to effectively lead their teams and drive their companies to success. </i>
 
 
<i>I'm looking forward to helping you achieve those goals. Please <b>[email me](mailto:asheren@gmail.com)</b> for more information and rates.
