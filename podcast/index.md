# Parent Driven Development
### A podcast about parenting in tech

Between staying up to date with emerging technologies and balancing work and home life in an industry that often requires un-timeable bug fixes, on call schedules, and more, working parents are balancing a lot.

Parents are also exploring additional technical issues like "screen time" or internet privacy, coming at these issues from a different perspective as technologists ourselves.

We cover all of these topics and more using a panel of parents coming from diverse perspectives and a variety of technological backgrounds. We'll shine light onto these issues and provide a valuable food for thought for these folks.
